						<h3>Process</h3>
                        <h5>Stage 1: Concept and Color Palette</h5>
					</div>
					<p>The process began with identifying main prioriites for the website as well as a color palette. (Note: the color palette did change slightly throughout as the logo was updated during this process). The clients vocalized that the elements most important to them were an about page for users to get to know the team better as well as a contact form for future guests.
					</p>
                    <div class="color-palettes">
					<img id="color-palette" src="images/just-stories/color-palette1.png" alt="Five Different Colors">
                    <hr>
                     <img id="color-palette" src="images/just-stories/color-palette2.jpg" alt="Five Different Colors">
					</div>
                    <p>On top is the first color palette decided upon based off of the previous logo which primarly utilized #E11425 and #00527A. Based off of those two colors, I chose three other colors to be incorporated throughout the site that were varrying shades of the logo colors to give a more seamless look. </p>
                    <p>
                    On the bottom is the finalized color palette based off of the updated logo. Similarly to the previous color palette, colors were chosen based off of three main shades used in the logo and varying shades of those colors. A slighly lighter shade of blue and slighly darker shade of pink were used to bring more light and better visiblity/color contrast than those used within the logo.
                    </p>

                    <br>
                <div class="center">
				<h5>Stage 2: High Fidelity Design</h5>
					</div>
					<p>After chosing a color palette I began creating a simple layout of elements using Adobe XD. The first version was a wireframe while the second version was branded and prototyped to flow through the site as a user would.

				<h5 class="center">Stage 3: HTML Layout and CSS</h5>
				<p>The third stage of this process is where the website began to come to life. Per the clients' request, the layout remained clean and simplistic with a fair amount of white space as well as chosing fonts to reflect this minimalistic style. I chose a fixed header to keep the logo front and center throughout the users' experience and a contact form at the bottom of each page for easy access.</p>
                <img class="navigation-animation" src="images/just-stories/recording1-js.gif" alt="Animation of just-stories homepage">
				<p>A problem I ran into early on was maintaining uniformity in a minimalistic design due to busy background in photos provided to me for the about page. To combat this conflict I decided to create custom graphics of each team member in a color blocking style to reduce any unwanted noise throughout the site. I accomplished this by utilizing Procreate and drawing layers for each element of the graphic.</p>
				<img class="navigation-animation" src="images/just-stories/recording2-js.gif" alt="Animation of team member graphic creation on procreate">
			</div>
			<div class="process-explained center">
				<p class="animation1-p">These graphics then became the icon and link to each biography for the team members. It also served as an element to encourage users' to navigate to the about page to "find out" who each graphic belongs to and learn more about the team. On the about page the user can click on each team member graphic and  Javascript smooth scrolling will take them to each individual biography.</p>
				<img class="navigation-animation" src="images/just-stories/recording3-js.gif" alt="Animation of smooth scrolling">
			</div>
			<div class="process-explained center">
				<p>On the podcast page I placed links to each site where users can find the podcast to listen to. Each link uses a css animation to change color as the users' mouse hovers over the button. Each link opens a separate window in the users' browser as to not close the podcast website using the "target" html tag. In addition to links, this page also contains a library of current episodes. The library is hosted in a scroll box to save space on the page itself and add more straight lines to the page continuing the simplistic look. </p>

                <h5>What is Next?</h5>
                <p>
                    Moving forward, I will be completing the contact form and it's backend development. Through PHP, I will be able to finalize this form for users' to be able to directly email the "Just Stories" team about becoming a possible future guest. This will give the clients' more leads moving forward. I will also be adding in a section on the "Connect" page that will display featured Facebook comments for users' to be able to scroll through, similar to reviews.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly I will be moving the website to a hosting website for the client, inserting any last needed content or graphics, setting up each media queries/break-points, and running through accessablity checks for the website.
